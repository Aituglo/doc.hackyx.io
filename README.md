# Welcome

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/main.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Hackyx</p></figcaption></figure>

In this place, I want to share with you all the content I found useful for Pentesting and Bug Bounty Hunting.

This will be a mix of my own content, rewriting of articles and content from others with a link to the original content at the end of the page.

You can make PR to this project and add your own content about IT Security. Make sure to add it in the correct section.

Have a great journey !
